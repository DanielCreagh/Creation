          <p>Having always been an amateur musician I now enjoy playing drums in local bands. With a history of musical performance I have played various different instruments including guitar, keyboard and turntables. One of the highlights of my life as a musician would have to be DJing in clubs and bars around Newcastle upon-Tyne city center.</p>

        <div class="jobblurb">
          <p>I generally read non-fiction books within the domain of science, politics, philosophy, business, technology and economics. I try to get as much modern cultural exposure as possible so am always listening to podcasts and also enjoy watching and chatting about new and obscure films and documentaries.</p>

          <p>Long-distance running is one of the ways I try and stay healthy. Being a regular participant in various running clubs and events I am always looking out for new and interesting trails to run. I also like to cycle and swim when the opportunities arise.</p>

        <div class="jobblurb">
          <p>Work life balance is important for productivity. I gauge work life balance on whether I have time in the evenings to cook for myself, my friends and my family.  Having worked in many kitchens and restaurants in my early years, at the height of which I was a line chef in a reputable italian restaurant chain ASK, I have acquired a good solid set of skills and standards which enable me to enjoy my time in the kitchen and produce some quality meals.</p>
