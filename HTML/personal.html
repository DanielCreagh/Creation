          <p>Having always been an amateur musician I now enjoy playing
          drums in local bands. With a history of musical performance I
          have played various different instruments including guitar,
          keyboard and turntables. One of the highlights of my
          life as a musician would have to be DJing in clubs and bars
          around Newcastle upon-Tyne city center.</p>

          <p>I generally read non-fiction books within the domain of science, politics, philosophy, business, technology and economics.
          I try to get as much modern cultural exposure as possible so am
          always listening to podcasts and also enjoy watching and chatting about new and obscure films
          and documentaries.</p>

          <p>Long-distance running is one of the ways I try and stay
          healthy. Being a regular participant in various running clubs and
          events I am always looking out for new and interesting trails to
          run. I have also recently taken up road cycling. Cycling has made my daily commute a little bit more refreshing and exciting.</p>
